#This is a test
- While I think html tags work <bold>test</bold>, it is faster to use markdown. For example instead of <code>int i</code>, we can use `int i`
This can be seen to have tremendous advantage, for example, traditionaly, a unordered list is declared like the following:
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
</ul>
it can be simply done through adding `-` infront of the statements, and child items added using identation. <br>
- This is an example
  - this is a child
